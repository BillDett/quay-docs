[[upgrade-to-quay-2.0.0]]
= Upgrade to Quay 2.0.0

All Quay instances being upgraded from versions < 2.0.0
*must* upgrade to Quay 2.0.0 first before continuing to
upgrade. This upgrade has an extra step, documented here.

We *highly* recommend performing this upgrade during a scheduled
maintenance window, as it will require taking the existing cluster down
temporarily.

[[download-quay-license]]
== Download Quay License

To begin, download your Quay License from your
https://account.tectonic.com[Tectonic Account]. Please download or copy
this license in *Raw Format* as a file named `license`:

[[shutdown-all-quay-instances]]
== Shutdown all Quay instances

Shutdown all running instances of Quay, across all clusters.

[[run-a-single-instance-of-quay-2]]
== Run a single instance of Quay 2

Run a single instance of Quay 2.0.0 by replacing
`quay.io/coreos/registry:{currentVersion}` with
`quay.io/coreos/quay:v2.0.0` in your run command, startup script, config
or systemd unit.

Quay setup as a container or under Kubernetes

* Visit the management panel:
image:../images/superuser.png[Log in as superuser to begin the upgrade process]

Sign in to a super user account from the Red Hat Quay login screen. For
example, if the host were reg.example.com, you would go to `http://reg.example.com/superuser`
to view the management panel:

* Click the configuration tab
* In the section entitled `License`, paste in the contents of the
license downloaded above
* Click `Save Configuration Changes`

[[add-license-via-the-filesystem]]
=== Add license via the filesystem

Ensure QE instance has been shutdown and add the raw format license in
`license` file to the directory mapped to `conf/stack`, next to the
existing `config.yaml`.

[[example]]
Example:

The `conf/stack` directory is mapped to `quay2/config` in `docker run` command used to
bring up Quay:

```
docker run --restart=always -p 443:443 -p 80:80 --privileged=true -v /quay2/config:/conf/stack -v /quay2/storage:/datastorage -d quay.io/coreos/quay:v2.0.0
```

The `license` file resides in the `quay2/config` directory:

```
$ ls quay2/config/
config.yaml  license

$ cat quay2/license
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzY2hlbWFWZXJzaW9uIjoidjIiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiMSIsImNyZWF0aW9uRGF0ZSI6IjIwMTYtMTAtMjZUMTc6MjM6MjJaIiwiZXhwaXJ
[...]
```

[[update-cluster]]
== Update cluster

Update all remaining Quay instances to refer to the new image
(`quay.io/coreos/quay:v2.0.0`).

[[verify-cluster]]
== Verify cluster

Verify that your cluster and its license are valid by performing a push
or pull. If you receive an HTTP `402`, please make sure your license is
properly installed and valid by checking in the management panel (see
above for instructions).

If you encounter unusual problems, please contact support.
