[[bittorrent-based-distribution]]
= Distributing Images with BitTorrent

Red Hat Quay supports BitTorrent-based distribution of its images to
clients via the https://github.com/coreos/quayctl[quayctl] tool.
BitTorrent-based distribution allows for machines to share image data
amongst themselves, resulting in faster downloads and shorter production
launch times.
