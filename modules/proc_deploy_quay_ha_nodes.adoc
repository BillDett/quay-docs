= Add other {productname} Nodes (high availability only)
If you are doing a high availability setup, follow these steps to set up the other Quay nodes:

. Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on the other Quay nodes (quay02 and quay03, in this example) and create the same configuration and storage directories.
. Copy the config.yaml file from the initial Quay systems to the others. For example:
+
```
# scp /mnt/quay/config/config.yaml quay02:/mnt/quay/config/
# scp /mnt/quay/config/config.yaml quay03:/mnt/quay/config/
```
. Run the quay and redis containers on the other nodes as you did on the first node. The configuration information will be used from the config.yaml file.
