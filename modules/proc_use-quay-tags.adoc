[[adding-a-new-tag-to-a-tagged-image]]
=== Adding a new tag to a tagged image

A new tag can be added to a tagged image by clicking on the gear icon next to
the tag and choosing `Add New Tag`. Quay.io will confirm the addition of
the new tag to the image.

[[moving-a-tag]]
=== Moving a tag

Moving a tag to a different image is accomplished by performing the same
operation as adding a new tag, but giving an existing tag name. Quay.io
will confirm that you want the tag moved, rather than added.

[[deleting-a-tag]]
=== Deleting a tag

A specific tag and all its images can be deleted by clicking on the tag's gear icon
and choosing `Delete Tag`. This will delete the tag and any images unique
to it. Images will not be deleted until no tag references them either
directly or indirectly through a parent child relationship.

[[viewing-tag-history-and-going-back-in-time]]
=== Viewing tag history and going back in time

[[viewing-tag-history]]
==== Viewing tag history

To view the image history for a tag, click on the `View Tags History` menu
item located under the `Actions` menu. The page shown will display each
image to which the tag pointed in the past and when it pointed to that
image.

[[going-back-in-time]]
==== Going back in time

To revert the tag to a previous image, find the history line where your
desired image was overwritten, and click on the Restore link.

[[security-scanning]]
== Security scanning

By clicking the on the vulnerability or fixable count next to a tab you
can jump into the security scanning information for that tag. There you
can find which CVEs your image is susceptible to, and what remediation
options you may have available.
