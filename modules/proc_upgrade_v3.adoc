[[upgrade-v3]] 
= Running the upgrade to Red Hat Quay v3

Choose between a synchronous upgrade (complete the upgrade in downtime)
and a background upgrade (complete the upgrade while Red Hat Quay is still running).
Both of these major-release upgrades require that the Red Hat Quay cluster be down
for at least a short period of time.

[[sync-upgrade-v3]] 
== Run a synchronous upgrade
To run a synchronous upgrade, where your whole cluster is down for the entire upgrade, do the following:

. Take down your entire Red Hat Quay cluster.

. Add the following setting to the `config.yaml` file on all nodes:
+
====
V3_UPGRADE_MODE: complete 
====

. Pull and start up the v3 container on a single node and wait for however long it takes to do the upgrade
(it should take just a few minutes). Use the following container or later:
+
====
quay.io/quay/quay:v3.0.0
====

. Monitor the `/upgradeprogress` API endpoint until it reports done (the status reaches 100%).
For example, view `https://myquay.example.com/upgradeprogress` or use some other tool to query the API.

. After the upgrade completes, bring the Red Hat Quay v3 container up on all other nodes.

. Verify that Red Hat Quay is working, including pushes and pulls of containers compatible with OCI version 2, schema 2.
This can include windows container images and images of different computer architectures (arm, ppc, etc.).

[[background-upgrade-v3]] 
== Run a background upgrade
To run a background upgrade, you need only bring down your cluster for a short period of time on two occasions. When you
bring the cluster back up after the first downtime, the quay v3 container runs in v2 compatibility mode as it backfills the database.
This background process can take hours or even days to complete. Background upgrades are recommended for
large installations where downtime of more than a few hours would be a problem.

For this type of upgrade, you put Red Hat Quay into a compatibility mode, where you have a v3 quay container
running, but it is running on the old data model while the upgrade completes. Here's what you do:

. Pull the Red Hat Quay v3 container to all the nodes. Use the following container or later:
+
====
quay.io/quay/quay:v3.0.0
====

. Take down Red Hat Quay on all nodes.

. Edit the `config.yaml` file on each node and set the upgrade mode to background as follows:
+
====
V3_UPGRADE_MODE: background
====

. Bring the Red Hat Quay v3 container up on a single node and wait for the migrations to
complete (should take a few minutes maximum).

. Bring the Red Hat Quay v3 container up on all the other nodes.

. Monitor the `/upgradeprogress` API endpoint until it reports done (the status reaches 100%).
For example, view `https://myquay.example.com/upgradeprogress` or use some other tool to query the API.

. Once the background process is done, you have to schedule another maintenance window.

. During your scheduled maintenance, take the entire Red Hat Quay cluster down.

. Edit the `config.yaml` file on each node and set the upgrade mode to `complete` as follows:
+
====
V3_UPGRADE_MODE: complete
====

. Bring Red Hat Quay back up on one node to have it do a final check.

. Once the final check is done, bring Red Hat Quay v3 back up on all the other nodes.

. Verify Quay is working, including pushes and pulls of containers compatible with OCI version 2, schema 2.
This can include windows container images and images of different computer architectures (arm, ppc, etc.).
