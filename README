Documentation for the {productname} product

These are some really basic guidelines to get started. 

Structure of this repo:
* Books go in a top level folder. For example: manage_quay. 
* Each book folder has a symlink to the top level modules folder.
* A book's TOC is defined in the master.adoc file contained within the book's folder.
* master.adoc contains includes to modules (chapters) which are created in the top level modules folder.
* You will also need to define a docinfo.xml in the book's folder to contain basic information about a book.

To get started:

(this assumes you have been granted read/write access to the GitLab repo. If not, contact the owner of this repo).

1. git clone https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-quay-documentation/quay-documentation.git
2. cd quay-documentation
3. <do you work and add and commit>
4. git push origin master

Once merge to master is done and you want to stage:

1. git fetch origin
2. git rebase origin/master
3. git checkout stage
4. git rebase origin/stage
5. git cherry-pick <commit-id> 

In the last step, you are cherry picking the commit id of your work in the master.

More instructions to follow once we have a full fledged product.
