= Deploy {productname} on OpenShift

:imagesdir: ./images

{productname} is an enterprise-quality container registry. Use Quay to build and
store containers, then deploy them to the servers across your enterprise.

This procedure describes how to deploy a {productname} setup to run on
an OpenShift cluster. Deploying {productname} on OpenShift is done by
running containerized versions of Redis, PostgreSQL, Quay and other services
using the `oc` command.
