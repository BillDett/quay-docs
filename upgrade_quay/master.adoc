= Upgrade to Red Hat Quay v3

:imagesdir: ./images

To upgrade from Red Hat Quay v2.x to v3, you can either do
the whole upgrade with Red Hat Quay down (Synchronous) or only bring down
Red Hat Quay for a few minutes and have bulk of the upgrade continue with
Red Hat Quay running (Background).

In a background upgrade, it could take much longer
to run the upgrade (depending on how many tags need to be processed),
but it takes less total downtime. The downside of a background upgrade is
that you won't have access to the latest features until the upgrade completes
(the cluster runs from quay v3 in v2 compatibility mode until the upgrade is done).

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_release_notes/index[Red Hat Quay Release Notes] for information on v3 features.
